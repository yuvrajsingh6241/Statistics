    "\n",
    "Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. It is mainly divided into two branches: Descriptive Statistics and Inferential Statistics. Both are important, but they serve different purposes in data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Descriptive Statistics**  \n",
    "Descriptive statistics are methods used to summarize and describe the important features of a dataset. It does not go beyond the available data; instead, it presents information in a clear and simplified form using numerical measures and visualizations. Common tools include mean, median, mode, standard deviation, tables, graphs, and charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A teacher calculates the average marks of 50 students in her class. She finds that the mean is 65, the highest is 95, and the lowest is 30. This is descriptive statistics because it only explains the data of those 50 students.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inferential Statistics**  \n",
    "Inferential statistics are techniques that allow us to make conclusions, predictions, or generalizations about a large population based on a sample. It uses probability theory, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* A researcher wants to know the average marks of 1000 students in a school. Instead of checking all students, he takes a sample of 100 students and finds their mean as 70. He then concludes that the average marks of the whole school are approximately 70. This is inferential statistics, as predictions are made from sample to population."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or observations from a larger group called the population. Since studying the entire population is often costly, time-consuming, or impossible, researchers collect data from a smaller group (sample) and use it to draw conclusions about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Random Sampling**  \n",
    "- **Definition:** Random sampling is a method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.  \n",
    "- **Process:** Names or numbers are selected using lottery method, random number tables, or computer-generated randomization.  \n",
    "- **Advantage:** Eliminates bias and ensures fairness.  \n",
    "- **Example:** Choosing 100 students randomly from a list of 1,000 students using a random number generator.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Stratified Sampling**  \n",
    "- **Definition:** Stratified sampling divides the population into subgroups (called strata) based on common characteristics like age, gender, or income, and then samples are taken from each stratum.  \n",
    "- **Process:** Population → divided into homogeneous groups → random samples taken proportionally.  \n",
    "- **Advantage:** Ensures better representation of all categories, reduces sampling error.  \n",
    "- **Example:** A school has 60% boys and 40% girls. To select 100 students, researcher takes 60 boys and 40 girls randomly instead of selecting only random students without considering gender."

    "**1. Mean**  \n",
    "The mean (also called average) is obtained by adding all the values in a dataset and dividing by the total number of values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Formula:*  \n",
    "Mean = (Sum of all observations) ÷ (Number of observations)  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Marks of 5 students = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.  \n",
    "Mean = (10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50) ÷ 5 = 30.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Median**  \n",
    "The median is the middle value of the dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Data = 15, 20, 25, 30, 35. Median = 25 (middle value).  \n",
    "If data = 10, 20, 30, 40 → Median = (20+30)/2 = 25.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mode**  \n",
    "The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* Data = 5, 7, 7, 8, 10, 7, 12 → Mode = 7 (most repeated value).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Importance of Mean, Median, and Mode**  \n",
    "- These are called measures of central tendency, because they represent the \"center\" or average behavior of the data.  \n",
    "- Mean gives an overall average, useful in comparing performances.  \n",
    "- Median is helpful when data has extreme values (outliers), as it is not affected by them.  \n",
    "- Mode is useful in categorical data analysis (e.g., the most popular product, most common marks).  \n",
    "- Together, they help in understanding, summarizing, and interpreting large datasets in research, economics, business, and everyday life."

    "\n",
    "**1. Skewness**  \n",
    "Skewness refers to the degree of asymmetry in the distribution of data values around the mean.  \n",
    "- If data is symmetrical, skewness = 0.  \n",
    "- If data is positively skewed, the tail of the distribution is longer on the right side.  \n",
    "- If data is negatively skewed, the tail is longer on the left side.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*  \n",
    "- Heights of people often follow a near-symmetric distribution (low skew).  \n",
    "- Income distribution is usually positively skewed, because a few very rich people pull the average upward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Kurtosis**  \n",
    "Kurtosis refers to the degree of peakedness or flatness of a data distribution compared to a normal distribution.  \n",
    "- **Mesokurtic:** Normal bell-shaped distribution (kurtosis ≈ 3).  \n",
    "- **Leptokurtic:** More peaked than normal, with heavy tails (kurtosis > 3).  \n",
    "- **Platykurtic:** Flatter than normal, with light tails (kurtosis < 3).  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*  \n",
    "- Exam scores that are tightly clustered around the mean → leptokurtic.  \n",
    "- Uniformly spread marks → platykurtic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Positive Skew and Its Implication**  \n",
    "A positive skew means the distribution has a longer right tail. Most of the data values lie to the left (lower values), while a few very high values pull the mean to the right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In a positively skewed distribution: Mean > Median > Mode  \n",
    "- Implication: Most individuals have relatively low values, but a small number of individuals have very high values.  \n",
    "*Example:* Income distribution in a country: most people earn low-to-average salaries, but a few billionaires create a long right tail."
